Greetings and a warm welcome to my corner of the internet! I am thrilled to introduce myself as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the esteemed [Department of Chemistry at the College of Staten Island, City University of New York (CUNY), USA](https://www.csi.cuny.edu/). Working with the accomplished [Prof. Sharon Loverde](https://sites.google.com/site/loverdelaboratory/) and her dynamic research group.  

My ongoing research efforts are focused on developing computational techniques to explore the structure and stability of the nucleosome core particle through a combination of all-atom and coarse-grained simulations.

I have completed my PhD from [S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, India (An autonomous institute under the Department of Science & Technology, Govt. Of India)](https://www.bose.res.in/) with [Prof. Jaydeb Chakrabarti](https://sites.google.com/view/softmatter-snbncbs). My [PhD thesis](https://www.culibrary.ac.in/digital-lib-dev/ebook/list_document.php?cat=1&department=555&document_folder=phd/T14408) explores the domain of molecular dynamics simulations as they relate to biomolecules like proteins, with a special emphasis on unraveling relaxation phenomena within proteins, particularly in relation to dihedral angles.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received an M.Sc. in Physics from [Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational Research Institute (RKMVERI)](https://physics.rkmvu.ac.in/) during which I worked with [Dr. Shamik Gupta](https://sites.google.com/view/shamikguptagroup/home).

Please feel free to drop an [email](mailto:abhik.moulick@csi.cuny.edu) if you have any queries.
