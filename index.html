I am thrilled to introduce myself as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the esteemed <a href="https://www.csi.cuny.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Chemistry at the College of Staten Island, City University of New York (CUNY), USA</a>. Working with the accomplished <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/loverdelaboratory/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Sharon Loverde</a> and her dynamic research group.</p> <p>My ongoing research efforts are focused on developing computational techniques to explore the structure and stability of the nucleosome core particle through a combination of all-atom and coarse-grained simulations.</p> <p>I have completed my PhD from [S. N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, India <a href="https://www.bose.res.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">An autonomous institute under the Department of Science &amp; Technology, Govt. Of India</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/softmatter-snbncbs" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Jaydeb Chakrabarti</a>. My <a href="https://www.culibrary.ac.in/digital-lib-dev/ebook/list_document.php?cat=1&amp;department=555&amp;document_folder=phd/T14408" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PhD thesis</a> explores the domain of molecular dynamics simulations as they relate to biomolecules like proteins, with a special emphasis on unraveling relaxation phenomena within proteins, particularly in relation to dihedral angles.</p> <p>Prior to my Ph.D., I received an M.Sc. in Physics from <a href="https://physics.rkmvu.ac.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational Research Institute (RKMVERI)</a> during which I worked with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/shamikguptagroup/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Shamik Gupta</a>.</p> <p>Please feel free to drop an <a href="mailto:abhik.moulick@csi.cuny.edu">email</a> if you have any queries.</p> </body></html>
